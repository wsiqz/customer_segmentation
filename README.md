# Online Gift Store Customers Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **customer segmentation** for an online gift store using **RFM analysis** and clustering techniques. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior to enhance targeted marketing strategies and improve customer relationship management.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from **The UCI Machine Learning Repository** and contains **transactional records from an online gift store** operating between **01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011**. The company sells unique gifts, with many of its customers being wholesalers.

### **Features:**

- **InvoiceNo** – Unique transaction ID (prefix 'C' indicates a canceled transaction).
- **StockCode** – Unique product ID.
- **Description** – Product name.
- **Quantity** – Number of units purchased.
- **InvoiceDate** – Date and time of transaction.
- **UnitPrice** – Price per unit in GBP (£).
- **CustomerID** – Unique customer identifier.
- **Country** – Customer's country.

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Removed transactions with missing `CustomerID` and `Description`.
2. **Duplicate Removal**
   - Identified and removed duplicate entries.
3. **Processing Returns & Special Transactions**
   - Created `QuantityCancelled` to track returned items.
   - Removed transactions containing special product codes (e.g., postage fees, bank charges).
4. **Filtering Outliers**
   - Removed transactions with zero or negative unit prices.
5. **Feature Engineering**
   - Calculated **TotalPrice** (`UnitPrice * (Quantity - QuantityCancelled)`).
   - Extracted **Purchase Time Features** (`Month`, `Weekday`, `Hour`).
   - Created a `IsWholesale` indicator (bulk orders).
   - Created **Unique Items Per Order** feature.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights extracted:

- **Top buying countries** (most orders and revenue contributors).
- **Seasonality in sales** (peak months, days, and hours of transactions).
- **Most valuable customers** based on spending.
- **Frequent return patterns** and affected products.
- **Average Order Value (AOV) distribution.**

## 🔍 Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

To cluster customers, we calculated the **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores**:

- **Recency** – Days since last purchase.
- **Frequency** – Total number of unique purchases.
- **Monetary** – Total spending amount.

## 🧠 Clustering Methods & Model Selection

### **Dimensionality Reduction:**

- **PCA** – Used to reduce high-dimensional data to 2D space.
- **t-SNE** – Used to reduce high-dimensional data to 2D space.

* **UMAP** – Used to reduce high-dimensional data to **2D space** (showed the best results).

### **Clustering Algorithms Tested:**

- **K-Means** (Best Model: K-Means with 5 Clusters, Silhouette Score: **0.6029**)
- **Agglomerative Clustering (Silhouette Score: 0.5897)**
- **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Clustering)
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** 

### **Handling Outliers:**

- Used **Isolation Forest** to remove extreme outliers before clustering.

## 🔍 Key Findings (Customer Segments)

1. **Loyal High-Spenders** – Frequently purchase and spend large amounts.
2. **Occasional Buyers** – Infrequent orders but moderate spending.
3. **New Customers** – Recently made first purchases.
4. **High-Value Inactive Customers** – Previously spent a lot but stopped buying.
5. **Discount Hunters** – Small but frequent purchases, possibly during sales.
6. **Churned Customers** – Haven’t purchased in a long time with low spending history.
